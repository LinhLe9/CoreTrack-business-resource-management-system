# Test Production Ticket Creation

## Steps to test:

1. **Start Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Login to the application**

4. **Create a Production Ticket**
   - Go to `/production/create`
   - Fill in the form:
     - Title: "Test Production Ticket"
     - Add a product variant
     - Set quantity and expected complete date
   - Submit the form

5. **Check Database**
   ```sql
   -- Check if production ticket was created
   SELECT * FROM production_ticket WHERE name = 'Test Production Ticket';
   
   -- Check if status logs were created
   SELECT * FROM production_ticket_status_log WHERE productionTicket_id = [ticket_id];
   SELECT * FROM production_ticket_detail_status_log WHERE productionTicketDetail_id = [detail_id];
   ```

6. **Check Frontend**
   - Go to `/production/[ticket_id]`
   - Verify that status logs are displayed

## Expected Results:
- Production ticket should be created
- Status logs should be created in both tables
- Frontend should display the status logs in the detail page

## Debug Information:
- Check backend console for the debug messages we added
- Look for "Created ticket status log with ID: X" messages
- Look for "Created detail status log with ID: X" messages
